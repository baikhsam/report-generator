VBA Macro created to read data from Excel worksheet and generate a report

Created during and for my internship at Global Energy Trading Pte Ltd of Singapore

To Do:
Implement more features (ask for more input: B & L outsiders, etc)
Add sample Excel workbook with changed/made-up data to showcase what report looks like
Optimize code (use arrays over Range, different implementation, etc)
Clean up code (variable names, etc)
